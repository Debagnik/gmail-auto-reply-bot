Ryo is shown to be an inconsistent student and temporarily forgets her musical knowledge when she studies for upcoming exams. She also has very strong opinions on how bands should present themselves, and encourages Bocchi to write genuine lyrics for Kessoku Band's material. Although her parents run a hospital and are very wealthy, she spends most of her pocket money on musical instruments. This has led her to borrow money from others up to the point where she even eats weeds when she can't afford food on her own. The reason she took interest in rock was to get her constantly doting parents to think she went down the wrong path and leave her alone.",

She sometimes hits Nijika and the members of Kessoku Band in her mouth, but in reality, she thinks of Kessoku Band more than anyone else. Although she didn't know that Bocchi was guitarhero, she was quick to realize her talent as a guitarist. She can be quite of a tsundere at times, especially when it comes to her little sister Nijika. For example, Nijika claimed that Seika opened Starry for her, even though Seika will never admit that. Also, it was known that she always saved a spot, wanting Kessoku Band to play even though she pretended she did not want them to. She also sleeps with her soft toys despite her age. Seika is very proud, frank and serious, and can be strict and somewhat harsh on the band members, especially her sister, who calls her a jerk when annoyed by her tsundere mannerisms. Despite this, she is ultimately a kind person who has good intentions, and in the end her strict and aloof nature is, in her opinion, the way to make the band do the best they can.",
